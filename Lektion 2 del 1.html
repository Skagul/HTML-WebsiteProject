				<p>“He took his hands off the oars and pulled in the mooring rope.<br> If I make a couple of loops, he thought, I can strap the axe on to my back. <br>He had a mental picture of what could happen to a man who plunged into the cauldron below a waterfall<br> with a sharp piece of metal attached to his body.</p>
				<p><strong>GOOD MORNING.</strong></p>
				<p>Vimes blinked. A tall dark robed figure was now sitting in the boat.</p>
				<p><em>'Are you Death?'</em><p>
				<p><strong>IT'S THE SCYTHE, ISN'T IT? PEOPLE ALWAYS NOTICE THE SCYTHE.</strong></p>
				<p><em>'I'm going to die?'</em></p>
				<p><strong>POSSIBLY.</strong></p>
				<p><em>'Possibly? You turn up when people are possibly going to die?'</em></p>
				<p><strong>OH, YES. IT'S QUITE THE NEW THING. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.</strong></p>
				<p><em>'What's that?'</em></p>
				<p><strong>I'M NOT SURE.</strong></p>

				<p>He ... saw a small but brightly lit chair on the sand. A robed figure was reclining in it, reading a book. A scythe was stuck in the sand beside it
				<br>A white, skeletal hand turned a page.</p><p><em>"You'll be Death, then?"
				</em> said Vimes</p><p><strong>AH, MISTER VIMES, ASTUTE AS EVER. GOT IT IN ONE,</strong> said Death, shutting the book on his finger to keep the place.</p><p><em>"I've see you before. ... And this is it, is it?"
				</em></p><p><strong>HAS IT NEVER STRUCK YOU THAT THE CONCEPT OF A WRITTEN NARRATIVE IS SOMEWHAT STRANGE?</strong> said Death.
				</p><p>Vimes could tell when people were trying to avoid something they really didn't want to say, and it was happening here.
				</p><p><em>"Is it?"</em> he insisted.<em> "Is this it? This time I die?"</em><p><strong>COULD BE.
				</strong></p><p><em>"Could be? What sort of an answer is that?"</em> said Vimes.
				</p><p><strong>... DON'T MIND ME. CARRY ON WITH WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING. I HAVE A BOOK.
				</strong></p><p>Vimes ... heard the sound of a chair being moved.
				<br><em>"Shouldn't you be somewhere else?"</em> he said.</p><p><strong>I AM,</strong> said Death, sitting down again.
				</p><p><em>"But you're here!</em></p><p><strong> AS WELL.</strong></p>
