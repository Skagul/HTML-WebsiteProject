	<h1>Cadian Shock Troopers</h1>
	<p>As a heavily industrialized and militarized planet, Cadia is able to supply the Shock Troopers with the finest equipment available. Their uniforms are camouflaged to suit the various terrains found in the Cadian wilderness. The M36 Kantrael lasrifle, the stock lasgun of the Shock Troopers, is noted for its robustness compared to other lasgun marks. The standard Cadian tri-dome helmet and mark XI re-breather allows Shock Troopers to withstand poison and gas attacks, as well as plague weapons, and permit limited operation within an airless environment. Officers are also noted for wearing a distinctive gorget used to contain refractor field generators. Cadian-pattern Grenade Launchers are the preferred squad support weapon of Cadian infantry, a twenty-round drum-fed weapon which fires 40mm Frag and Krak grenades with considerable recoil, while autocannons are favored among heavy weapon squads.</p>
