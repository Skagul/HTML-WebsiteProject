	<h1>Catachan Jungle Fighters</h1>
	<p>Catachans are known to wear red bandanas that symbolize a blood oath they take when joining a regiment. They sport tattoos and commonly dull their regimental badges with soot and soil so as to not reveal their position.
	A common rite of passage among Jungle Fighters is for junior soldiers to earn their "Catachan name," a sobriquet that acknowledges their battle experiences and/or some notable quality of theirs. For example, Colonel Straken's nickname "Iron Hand" comes from the bionic arm which replaced the one he lost to a Miral Land Shark, while Gunnery Sergeant "Stonetooth" Harker's reputation for toughness is such that he was able to kill a Tyranid Ravener by crushing its neck between his biceps, and was rumored to chew glass the way other men chew tobacco (though this latter is probably an exaggeration).</p>
