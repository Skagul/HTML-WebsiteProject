	<h1>Mordian Iron Guard</h1>
	<p>The Iron Guards prefer to go into combat wearing the same dress-style uniforms they do on the parade ground. The bright colors and elaborate decoration on Mordian uniforms often mislead their enemies into thinking they are facing ceremonial troops with little combat experience, though this misapprehension is usually corrected as soon as they attempt to advance in the face of the Iron Guards' precise volleys and unyielding resolve. Upon their formation each regiment is presented a lavish banner, created within the Tetrarchal Palace, during a ceremony at which every Guardsman swears to never let it fall or be captured. Their preferred squad special weapon is the Grenade Launcher while the Lascannon is the principle heavy weapon.</p>
