				<p>“He took his hands off the oars and pulled in the mooring rope.<br> If I make a couple of loops, he thought, I can strap the axe on to my back. <br>He had a mental picture of what could happen to a man who plunged into the cauldron below a waterfall<br> with a sharp piece of metal attached to his body.</p>
				<p><strong>GOOD MORNING.</strong></p>
				<p>Vimes blinked. A tall dark robed figure was now sitting in the boat.</p>
				<p><em>'Are you Death?'</em><p>
				<p><strong>IT'S THE SCYTHE, ISN'T IT? PEOPLE ALWAYS NOTICE THE SCYTHE.</strong></p>
				<p><em>'I'm going to die?'</em></p>
				<p><strong>POSSIBLY.</strong></p>
				<p><em>'Possibly? You turn up when people are possibly going to die?'</em></p>
				<p><strong>OH, YES. IT'S QUITE THE NEW THING. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.</strong></p>
				<p><em>'What's that?'</em></p>
				<p><strong>I'M NOT SURE.</strong></p>
				<p><em>'That's very helpful.”</em></p>
				<p><strong>― Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant</strong></p>
