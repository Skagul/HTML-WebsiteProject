	<h1>On the road towards learning!</h1>
	<article>
		<p>I start my journey toward the educational center HCB.<br>
		The first step on my journey begins with the push of a door handle,<br> where I am greeted by the cold air of a city where the snow has yet to melt<br>
		I step outside and i go about five steps towards my bike, a bike that is older than me,<br> I have a newer bike, one for training. But I don't dare leave it in public places for a whole day.<br> Since I have a bike I care little of I lean down to the lock which has four tumblers,<br> I grab all four tumblers with my thumb slide them all one number up,<br> the bike unlocks and I ride the ten minute ride to the train station.</p>
	<h2>At the train station</h2>
		<p>I proceed to life my bike down a staircase instead of riding around the entire area.<br> I reach for the lock that I have hanging on my handlebars, and I lock my bike <br>by sliding all the tumblers down one number.<br>
		I reach the board that tells my that my train is on time and I'm not supprised<br>
		My Train has not been late since they changed the timetable in january,<br> so it could run 3 minutes earlier thereby not having to wait for other trains<br>
		I wait inside the station for my train to arrive and then board it, as the conductor comes around <br>I make sure to wish him or her a good day, because I rememeber that it's early in the morning for them aswell.<br>
		Because what comes around, goes around.</p>
	<h2>The train ride</h2>
		<p>The train rides short and enjoy the view as the train speeds across the landscape<br> I always enjoyed riding the train, as I arrive in Uddevalla I take a connection to Ã–stra station, <br> that is within walking distance from the school.</p>
	<h2>In the Halls of Learning</h2>
		<P> The trip to the school does not end, before I have bought my cup of coffe in the cafeteria next door, as I recive the cup I wish the old lady a good day and walk in to the classroom.</p>
