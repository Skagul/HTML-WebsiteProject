	<p>This morning is going to be quite special, seven weeks ago I invited the prince of <strong>Sweden</strong> to a race, not only did he accept, but as in days of old the one who accepts a challange chooses the weapon. He must have done his research, because he chose a 911 Porsche, a car that has not evolved in 50 years, a car based upon a Volkswagen</p>
	<p>He must have known that I prefer to drive cars that are actually safe on the road, and cars with grip, while I won't deny that sometimes a Porsche can be eye candy, even some of the prettiest eye candy. as a trackday car I rather have a modern day VW Golf GTI</p>

	<h2>Up to the starting line</h2>
	<p>I started to think of all the things I could say to the prince about Porsche and about it's qualities as a trackday car, and what car I would have instead, but then I remeberd I am sitting here In a Porsche about to race the prince of sweden, in a Porsche provided by the prince. I should just <strong>shut up and race</strong>.
	I need to remeber that I am extremly lucky to be here in this position right now</p>
	<h2>The Princes car speeds off</h2>
	<p><em>Wait did he start already?</em> Damn! it already started there I was thinking of other things! no fair!</p> 
	<p>As quick as a bullet I reach for the start button where the ignition key would be on a street car, the engine revs, my tires screech and I speed off, but the prince has already a 20 second lead. I don't think I could make that up not, but I enter what I like to call my zen mode</p>
	<h2>We are going to need a montage</h2>
	<p>The day is approaching to give it your best<br />
	You've got to reach your prime!<br />
	That's when you need to put yourself to the test<br />
	And show us the passage of time</p>
	<p>We're gonna need a montage (Montage)<br />
	A sports-training montage (Montage)</p>

	<h2>The race is over</h2>
	<p>After my Zenlike Montage mode was over when I cross the finish line I realise that I did not win, not that I expected to do so, especially in a Porsche but I did only finish 15 seconds after the Prince so in a way I did drive faster than the prince, ill take that victory quietly. It's up to others to mention it. </p>
