	<h1>Me and my dog named Cowboy</h1>
	<article>
	<p>Now this is the story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell you how I, <strong>wait</strong> I think this is the beginning of a 90's tv show</p>

	<p>So this is a short story of me and my dog This morning, I let him in from the porch and was walking to our kitchen. <strong>Cowboy</strong> was walking so close to my legs, stopping when I stopped, and refused to let me turn a corner. That's when I realized: he was trying to herd me. Where was I being herded? To his food bowl. Apparently I was taking to long to feed him. </p>
	
	<h2>Another short story</h2>
	<p>Now Cowbody personality as you can fit inside a dog that small. He loves everyone, especially other little  creatures.
	Recently every time I feed him a snack, like a bit of carrot or apple, he takes it outside and disappears with it. I figured he had probably found himself a hiding spot and was cozy eating his food there, no biggie.
	This morning I decided to follow him to find that he takes his snacks, and feeds them to a hoard of pigeons that congregate behind our house. He's like... the pigeon king. He drops it on the ground and sits there regally as they tear each other apart for his teeny slice of apple.
	Can't decide if he's really twisted, or has a Robin Hood mentality going on. Either way, we're all pretty amused.</p>
