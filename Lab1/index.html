	<article>
	<P>My hobby, about being a <mark>GM</mark> (a <mark>Game Master</mark>) is all about creating a world, for your players, how I describe it the first time I tell people about it, I usually call it an “improv” group, seeing as it has some similarities with “improv-theater” the players take on characters, these characters can have different ideals, speech pattern or other attributes. 	
	<h2> A role playing game</h2>
	
	<p> My players are rely on me as the <mark>GM</mark> to paint them up a mental picture of the world they are currently inhabiting, all from how the sky looks how the grass feels to how it smells or sounds. I might answer some questions the player have to further elaborate and then I ask the iconic question<em> What do you do? </em>
	
	<h2> Do you open that door?  </h2>
	
	<p>My plays have to roam around in a world of my creation and try to make their mark on it, I set up challenges to overcome and beasts to slay, but also civilians to save, I can also venture into moral grey areas where I set up players to maybe sacrifice the few to save the many or save someone who does not want saving, and remember if your <mark>GM</mark> asks: <em>Do you really want to do this? </em> <strong>DO NOT DO IT</strong>.
